# Django-ActOS
An Activity Online Sheet to Monitor and Measure Your Team Performance

The Raw Ideas : 
Imagine in Finance and Accounting, they have GL Account and  Cost Element as placeholder to track and monitor income & expense
with ActOS, we can use Project-Tasks as placeholder on our team activity timesheet 
then you can measure the productivity and contribution rate of your team
