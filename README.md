# Django-ActOS
An Activity Online Sheet to Monitor and Measure Your Team Performance

The Raw Ideas : 

Imagine in Finance and Accounting, they have GL Account and  Cost Element as placeholder to track and monitor income & expense.

With ActOS, we can use Project-Tasks as placeholder on our team activity timesheet.
Then you can measure the productivity and contribution rate of your team.

Technology Stack : PostgreSQL - Django Full Stack - Bootstrap
